Technical Specifications   3.1	 Basic Structure of the System  The System will basically be an integrated enterprise resource planning application with four major modules: Accounting Module, Procurement and Supply Management Module, Hr Management Module, Customer Relationship Management Module. The suggested name for the System is BrimasLead. These modules will however be applied seamlessly in BrimasLead without necessarily demarcating the specific module.   This will work in a way that each user will be assigned rights and the user will access the module according to the rights that they have been granted. For example, when a user with accountant rights logs into the system, they will access the account module window and resources. This means different users will access the system differently according to their roles. This is to help in the ownership and accountability of records.  The system will have a user Dashboard where common functionalities will be shared. These may include but not limited to: Employee Profile-Personal (Contact, email, emery contact, bank account etc.); Job (Job Information, Job family framework, Performance etc.); User Photo and Menu to other modules depending on what they are doing. The System will be purely web based though it will be able to be deployed as standalone or on the LAN network
